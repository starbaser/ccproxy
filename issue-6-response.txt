Yes, don't break ToS and I have no liability for anyone's accounts! I am shifting the focus away towards being an educational tool or for personal tweaks here and there now that a firm stance by the IP holder has been made. It's too much effort to maintain a feature that will get the repo taken down.

To answer your question directly though - no, sharing credentials with others isn't something I'd support or help with, regardless of IP. That's squarely in ToS violation territory and not what this project is for.

If you're interested in understanding how LLM proxies work or want to customize your own workflow, cool. But I'm not going to be providing help for anything that looks like credential sharing.

Anyway, I've got a day job that keeps me pretty busy so this is very much a side project I poke at when I have time. Eventually I'll get around to better documentation and making the intended use cases clearer, but for now it is what it is.
